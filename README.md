# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project consists of a C++ program that implements different sorting algorithms and data structures. The program currently displays different sorting algorithms and a data structure in the console, you can observe the behavior of each one. The main objective is to improve knowledge in data structures and algorithms as you see the behavior of each one.

## Project Progress

The project is currently equipped with a variety of menus, providing access to an extensive range of sorting algorithms and the data structure of a Stack. The project operates with a multitude of classes, each tailored to cater to the specific needs of the user. This flexible design allows users to access and interact with different components seamlessly.

## Instructions to compile the project progress
Run the following command in the terminal:

`g++ main.cpp` 

## Instructions to execute the project progress
Run the following command in the terminal:

1. For linux:
`./a.out` 

2. For Windows:
`a.exe`

## Description of the Inputs of the Project Progress

1. **Main Menu:**
   - Format: Integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
   - Example: User selects 2 for sorting algorithms.

2. **Algorithm Selection:**
   - Format: Integer (e.g., 1, 2, 3).
   - Example: User selects 3 for Merge Sort.

3. **Stack Operations:**
   - Format (Add Element): Integer.
   - Example: User adds the number 42 to the stack.

4. **Invalid Inputs:**
   - Format: Any invalid input (e.g., letters or out-of-range numbers).
   - Example: User enters "abc," an error message is displayed.

## Description of the Outputs of the Project Progress

1. **Sorting Algorithm Visualization:**
   - Displays intermediate sorting steps using ASCII bars.

2. **Stack Operations:**
   - Presents the current state of the stack after operations.

3. **Error Messages:**
   - Reports invalid inputs or errors with descriptive messages.

4. **Return to Main Menu:**
   - Allows seamless navigation back to the main menu for further interactions.

5. **Algorithm Statistics:**
   - Provides information on comparisons and swaps made during sorting.

6. **Farewell Message:**
   - Concludes the program with a friendly goodbye message to the user.
